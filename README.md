# Nether Reactor

Do you miss that simple nether reactor before?(Even though it'll break your buildings.)

Are you tired of the new nether?(Even though the new nether was full of funny.)

Do you no longer want to explore?(Even though exploring is an interesting thing.)

Look, we took the nether reactor back.

Just need 3 iron ingots, 6 diamonds, 4 gold blocks and some cobble stones, you can make the nether reactor.

Enjoy it!
